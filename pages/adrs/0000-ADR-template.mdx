## Status

## Context

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts.
</Callout>

## Decision

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">

## Consequences

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
